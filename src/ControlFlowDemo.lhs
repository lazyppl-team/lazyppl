We consider a simple but slightly contrived model to illustrate how control flow transformations and laziness can be advantageous. Our first prior on pairs of booleans.
\begin{code}
prior1 :: Prob (Bool,Bool)
prior1 = 
  do x <- bernoulli 0.5
     y <- if x then bernoulli 0.4 else bernoulli 0.7
     return (x,y)
\end{code}
Our model conditions on the two booleans being equal. This means that if `x` changes, `y` has to change too, and vice versa. 
\begin{code}
model :: Prob (Bool,Bool) -> Meas Bool
model prior =
  do (x,y) <- sample prior
     score (if x==y then 1 else 0)
     return x
\end{code}
The posterior probability of `(model prior1)` returning true is 4/7. 

Since `x` and `y` are correlated, it is not a good idea to use a naive Metropolis Hastings simulation. But this is an extreme example, and less extreme examples might appear in more complex probabilistic programs that do benefit from Metropolis Hastings simulation, where the correlations are not known in advance. 

Here is a second implementation of the prior. It is mathematically equivalent, and computationally equivalent on each run, because of laziness. With Metropolis-Hastings, it is asymptotically the same (of course, as long as the proposal is irreducible -- see below). But in practice this prior works better with Metropolis-Hastings because it explicitly uses different sites for the two different conditional branches. 
\begin{code}
prior2 :: Prob (Bool,Bool)
prior2 =
  do x <- bernoulli 0.5
     ytrue <- bernoulli 0.4
     yfalse <- bernoulli 0.7
     return (if x then (x,ytrue) else (x,yfalse)) 
\end{code}
Of course, we could solve this particular program analytically. The point is rather that we have a universal program transformation manipulation that could be applied automatically. 

The following chart shows that the effective sample size (the ratio between the variance of a single true sample and the variance among the generated samples) is much better with this second implementation of the prior, although Metropolis Hastings is still far from optimal for this contrived problem.

Irreducibility 
----

This example also illustrates the issue with potential irreducibility in single-site Metropolis Hastings (`mh1`): the first implementation of the prior is especially bad, because _all_ proposals will be rejected except perhaps one.
This irreducibility arises from the hard constraints (scores of `0`) and is avoided to some extent with a softer constraint:
\begin{code}
softModel :: Prob (Bool,Bool) -> Meas Bool
softModel prior =
  do (x,y) <- sample prior
     score (if x==y then 0.9 else 0.1)
     return x
\end{code}

Note about different Metropolis-Hastings kernels in general
----

These are contrived examples and the reader should not conclude that all-sites Metropolis-Hastings outperforms the more complex Metropolis-Hastings algorithms of LazyPPL in general. To emphasise this, we plot the precision in the intercept for a linear regression example (similar to <a href="Regression.html">here</a>). 
\begin{code}
linreg :: Meas (Double,Double)
linreg =
  do
    a <- sample $ normal 0 3
    b <- sample $ normal 0 3
    let dataset = [(0,5), (0.1,10), (0.2,0)]
    mapM (\(x, y) -> score $ normalPdf (a*x + b) 0.5 y) dataset
    return (a,b)
\end{code}
![](images/controlflow-prec.png)

(Here we plot precision, which is proportional to effective sample size, because a general effective sample size analysis isn't written yet.)
